<h1>MindAnchor Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2, 2025<br>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Shaw Creative Works, LLC</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>MindAnchor – ADHD Planner (“the App”) is developed by Shaw Creative Works, LLC to help users manage focus, time, and mental clarity. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
<p>MindAnchor is designed with privacy first. All user data — including tasks, notes, brain dumps, check-ins, and settings — is stored locally on your device. The App does not transmit, collect, or store your data on external servers or databases. If you have iCloud backup enabled, Apple may store encrypted backups according to their privacy policy.</p>

<h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Permission</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Stored/Shared?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Notifications</td><td>To send gentle daily reminders (e.g., re-center, check-ins)</td><td>No data stored or shared</td></tr>
<tr><td>Microphone</td><td>For optional voice dictation in Brain Dump</td><td>Audio processed locally; never transmitted</td></tr>
<tr><td>Calendar</td><td>For syncing events with Apple Calendar</td><td>Remains on your device</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>4. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
<p>MindAnchor does not use any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking frameworks. Anonymous, aggregate download data may be available through Apple’s App Store Connect analytics, managed entirely by Apple.</p>

<h2>5. Account Information</h2>
<p>MindAnchor does not require or support account creation, login, or sign-up of any kind. No usernames, passwords, or identifying information are collected.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>All data is stored locally on your device and protected by your device’s built-in security features such as passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID. We recommend keeping your device up-to-date and using iCloud backups for data safety.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>MindAnchor is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us immediately.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any material changes will be reflected here with an updated “Last Updated” date.</p>
